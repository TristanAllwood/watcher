watcher
=======

inotify based watching/dev tool, using a Makefile-style config syntax.
This is a prototype.

As an example of the syntax, see the .watcher file in this repository.

See also the ruby tool guard [1], which is probably more mature / flexible.
Also relevant is inotifywait from the inotify-tools project [2].
