watcher
=======

inotify based watching/dev tool, using a Makefile-style config syntax.
Please note, this is a work-in-progress prototype.

The config file specifies (wordexp expanded) file patterns to match, followed
by a sequence of commands to run when those file are modified.  As an example
of the syntax, see the .watcher file in this repository.

See also the ruby tool guard [1], which is probably more mature / flexible.
Also relevant is inotifywait from the inotify-tools project [2].
